## Chemical mechanism store

Please note, any file that starts with 'MCM_..' has been extracted from the [Master Chemical Mechanism website](http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/MCM/). As noted via the MCM project website, please add a citation to the MCM website and the relevant mechanism  construction protocols using the following or comparable wording:                                               

    The chemical mechanistic information was taken from the Master Chemical Mechanism, MCM v3.3.1 (ref), via website:
    http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/MCM.                                       * ;
    The reference should be: 
     (Jenkin et al., Atmos. Environ., 31, 81, 1997; Saunders et al., Atmos. Chem. Phys., 3, 161, 2003), for non aromatic schemes; 
     (Jenkin et al., Atmos. Chem. Phys., 3, 181, 2003; Bloss et al., Atmos. Chem. Phys., 5, 641, 2005), for aromatic schemes; 
     (Jenkin et al., Atmos. Chem. Phys.,  12, 5275, 2012), for the beta-caryophyllene scheme and 
     (Jenkin et al.,Atmos. Chem. Phys., 15, 11433, 2015), for the isoprene scheme.
